# Getting Started with Arduino

Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer. The Arduino Software (IDE) allows you to write programs and upload them to your board. In the Arduino Software page you will find two options:

If you have a reliable Internet connection, you should use the online IDE (Arduino Web Editor). https://auth.arduino.cc/login It will allow you to save your sketches in the cloud, having them available from any device and backed up. You will always have the most up-to-date version of the IDE without the need to install updates or community generated libraries.

If you would rather work offline, you should use the latest version of the desktop IDE. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#download
